## My process

### Built with

- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for semantic markup and styling
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive grid and layout components
- **Google Fonts** for typography (using Lora and Poppins font families)

### What I learned

While building this template, I improved my skills in responsive design with Bootstrap and gained insights into structuring HTML content for readability. Implementing the testimonials and downloadable report sections helped reinforce my understanding of modular layout components.

### Continued development

or future projects, I plan to:

- Explore other responsive frameworks, like Tailwind CSS, to compare with Bootstrap.
- Experiment with adding JavaScript interactivity for more engaging user experiences.
- Improve accessibility by implementing ARIA attributes and testing screen reader compatibility.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - Invaluable for learning about responsive grid layout and utilities.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Great resource for enhancing typography.
